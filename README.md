## Hangouts: a Peer to Peer video chat application
### Built using simple-peer, WebRTC, and simple-signal in Node

#### Usage:
After signing in, a list of all users currently online is displayed. Copy the ID
of the user you'd like to call and paste it in 'ID to call'. If the user you called
accepts, the call will start. A third user can request to join the call by pasting
 in the corresponding roomID in 'RoomID to call'.
